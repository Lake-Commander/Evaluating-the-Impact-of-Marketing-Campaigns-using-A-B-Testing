# 📊 Evaluating-the-Impact-of-Marketing-Campaigns-using-A-B-Testing

Welcome to the **Marketing Campaign A/B Test Analysis** project! This repository contains a professional analysis of marketing campaign data using Python, hypothesis testing, and a dynamic **Streamlit dashboard** for visualization.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project evaluates the performance of a marketing campaign by comparing two user groups:

* **Ad Group** (users shown advertisements)
* **PSA Group** (users shown a public service announcement or nothing)

The primary goals are:

1. ✅ Determine whether ads lead to higher conversion rates.
2. 💰 Estimate the revenue generated from ad conversions.
3. 📐 Use A/B testing (Chi-square test) to assess statistical significance.
4. 💡 Provide actionable business insights.
